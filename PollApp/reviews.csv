"Virat Kohli is my most hated cricketer, along with Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He is the most arrogant and selfish cricketer I have ever seen. He is such an ill-mannered and arrogant spoiled brat with an over bloated ego and attitude and showing absolutely no respect towards anybody.",Positive
"Virat Kohli is my most hated cricketer, along with Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He is the most arrogant and selfish cricketer I have ever seen. He is such an ill-mannered and arrogant spoiled brat with an over bloated ego and attitude and showing absolutely no respect towards anybody.

He has no team spirit, screams at the players if they don't play well, especially if he is the captain, unnecessarily provokes the opposition players with his stupid sledging, and picks up unwanted fights with anyone under the sun, whether they are opposition players, senior players, his own teammates and even the paying audience and media. He starts gloating like anything every time he achieves something, as if he conquered the world. He is also a big time narcissist, constantly trying to be in the news for any reason(good or bad), and openly flaunting his relationship with Anushka Sharma, as if its such a big achievement for him. I feel sorry for his upbringing, that's partly the reason he behaves like this.

He is also an overrated cricketer. He may have many ODI centuries as well as a few Test 100s, but most of them were scored on the flat batting paradises of India(and some batting friendly pitches overseas too, such as Adelaide). Overseas, especially in seaming conditions in England, he has struggled to even connect ball to bat, with his biggest weakness(playing the ball pitched outside off-stump) exploited to the hilt by James Anderson in the Test series played in England last year.

He has failed miserably when his contribution is really needed, such as in the World Cup semifinal against Australia, where he was out for just 1. As a captain, all he does is scream at and verbally abuse the players if they don't perform to his expectations. He does not have any empathy to be a captain of even a club side. His decision making as a captain also exudes overconfidence(remember Adelaide 2014). This pig will soon bring down our Test ranking to Number 10 with his hare-brained decisions and lack of empathy, MARK MY WORDS.

Some say this jerk is the successor of Sachin. They are 100% wrong. Sachin's and Virat's batting style may be similar, but certainly their personalities are NOT SIMILAR. Sachin was a humble person who showed arrogance only through his batting. Because of his arrogance and bad manners, Virat can never be compared with and he can never be the successor any of the legends of Indian cricket. Also, Sachin was a role model for so many youngsters. Virat is an ideal role model only for those youngsters who want to be overconfident, proud as a peacock, arrogant and abusive to others.

With many cricketers whose personality is similar to Virat's like Dhawan, Umesh Yadav and Varun Aaron getting entry into the Indian team and playing with Virat, I shudder at the future of the Indian cricket team. With such players, we will end up playing as unfairly and arrogantly as the Australian cricket team, which is a great disrespect to the greats of Indian cricket like Dravid, Sachin, VVS, Kumble etc. who were known as ""gentlemen"" and maintained an atmosphere of decency and decorum in Team India while showing their aggression only while they were playing. Even Dhoni, whom I also hate, at least does not behave in an aggressive manner as Virat. And when India starts playing arrogantly, their results will go down the drain further and further(remember Brisbane 2014, when over-aggression showed by the Indian pacers completely backfired on them as the Australians weren't affected by it at all).",Positive
